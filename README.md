# Mobile Checkout Optimization: Revenue Recovery Project
**Project Lead:** Snigdha Nath  
**Tools:** Excel (Data Analytics) | Jira (Agile/Kanban) | Confluence (Stakeholder Documentation)

## 📊 Executive Summary
This project identifies a critical technical barrier within the mobile checkout funnel. Through deep-dive data analysis, a **70% transaction failure rate** was discovered specifically for mobile users. This resulted in an estimated revenue loss of **€504.00 per week**. I initiated a technical remediation plan via Jira to recover approximately **€2,016 in monthly revenue**.

## 📈 1. Data-Driven Insights (Excel)
A comparison between Desktop and Mobile performance revealed a significant technical disparity:
* **Desktop Success Rate:** 100%.
* **Mobile Success Rate:** 30%.
* **Financial Impact:** An Average Order Value of **€72.00** led to a calculated weekly loss of **€504.00**.

## ⚙️ 2. Agile Execution (Jira)
To manage the fix, I deployed a **Kanban framework** to prioritize engineering tasks:
* **Bug Remediation (MCF-1):** Addressed a critical UI issue where the payment button was hidden on mobile viewports.
* **Workflow Management:** Managed tasks from "To Do" to "Done" to ensure visibility for all stakeholders.

## 📝 3. Quality & Technical Standards
I defined strict **Acceptance Criteria** to ensure a permanent solution:
* **Responsiveness:** Payment buttons must be fully functional across all modern mobile viewports.
* **Compatibility:** Ensured cross-browser functional consistency.
* **UX Recovery:** Proposed a **"Retry" button (MCF-3)** to reduce total cart abandonment.

## 💡 Lessons Learned
* **Proactive Monitoring:** Implementing real-time alerts for checkout failures allows the team to identify revenue-dropping bugs within hours.
* **Testing Standards:** Mandatory UI testing on varying screen viewports (iPhone 13-15) is a prerequisite for every deployment.
